The key contract: If two objects are equal (according to equals()), they must have the same hash code. However, 
two objects with the same hash code don't have to be equal (collision).


Short answer: 31
.31 is small
.odd
.prime
.equals 32 - 1  (gives a good distribution for common inputs)
can be computed quickly as (i << 5) - i

1) Polynomial rolling idea (what 31 actually does)

h = 0;
for each character c:
    h = 31 * h + c;
    
This treats the sequence like a polynomial in base 31:
h = c0*31^(n-1) + c1*31^(n-2) + ... + cn-1
